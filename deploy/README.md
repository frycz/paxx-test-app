# Deploy Directory

This directory is optional and can be safely removed if not needed.

It's useful when using deployment examples from `deploy-examples/`. Use `paxx` to add an example deployment.

Example:
```bash
paxx deploy add linux-server
```

Then, follow instructions in a deployment `README.md` file to proceed further.
